# MiladTech Support

**MiladTech common** support helpers, contracts, and traits required by various MiladTech packages. Validator functionality, and basic controller included out-of-the-box.


> **Note:** this package is just a support package for other MiladTech packages, which may not be useful on it's own, but contains some complementary generic functionality and also may not respect SemVer and break backward compatibility.


## Installation

Install via `composer require miladtech/laravel-support`


## Usage

## Support Helpers

### `intend()`

The `intend` method returns redirect response:
```php
intend([
    'route' => 'route.name.here',
    'withErrors' => ['error.message.id' => 'A custom error message'],
]);
```

> **Note:** this helper accepts `redirect` methods as it's input keys, such as `withErrors`, `with`, `back`, and `route` ..etc

### `mimetypes()`

The `mimetypes` method gets valid mime types:

$mimetypes = mimetypes();
```
